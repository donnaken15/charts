loading_phrase = You've been babysitting yourself again, and now you bring on a pantomime horse, with all its special effects. On that silly hobby horse; caught up on the dance of fools; hanging up carrots in front of ass's blinkered eyes; your eyes. Never eat anything bigger than your head, and we shall dance the fool again. And we do, and we do.
